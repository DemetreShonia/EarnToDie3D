# Earn to Die 3D 🧟‍♂️🚨🚗

Welcome to **Earn to Die 3D**, a modern recreation of the classic 2D action game in 3D! Made with love in Unity by me and [JustZuka](https://github.com/justzuka). Drive through hordes of zombies, upgrade your vehicles, and escape the apocalypse in this thrilling 3D version of the game! We used the Same UI and musics that are given in the original game. It makes game more nostalgic :D
